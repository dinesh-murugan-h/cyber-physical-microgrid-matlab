# Abstract:
#       Template makefile for building a UNIX-based stand-alone embedded 
#       real-time version of Simulink model using generated C code.
#
#       This makefile attempts to conform to the guidelines specified in the
#       IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (POSIX) standard. It is designed to be used
#       with GNU Make which is located in matlabroot/rtw/bin.
#
#       Note that this template is automatically customized by the build 
#       procedure to create "<model>.mk"
#
#       The following defines can be used to modify the behavior of the
#       build:
#         OPT_OPTS       - Optimization options. Default is -O.
#         CPP_OPTS       - C++ compiler options.	
#         OPTS           - User specific compile options.
#         USER_SRCS      - Additional user sources, such as files needed by
#                          S-functions.
#         USER_INCLUDES  - Additional include paths
#                          (i.e. USER_INCLUDES="-Iwhere-ever -Iwhere-ever2")
#
#       To enable debugging:
#         set DEBUG_BUILD = 1 below, which will trigger OPTS=-g and
#          LDFLAGS += -g (may vary with compiler version, see compiler doc) 
#
#       This template makefile is designed to be used with a system target
#       file that contains 'rtwgensettings.BuildDirSuffix' see ert.tlc


#------------------------ Macros read by make_rtw ------------------------------
#
# The following macros are read by the build procedure:
#
#  MAKECMD         - This is the command used to invoke the make utility
#  HOST            - What platform this template makefile is targeted for
#                    (i.e. PC or UNIX)
#  BUILD           - Invoke make from the build procedure (yes/no)?
#  SYS_TARGET_FILE - Name of system target file.

MAKECMD         = /usr/local/MATLAB/R2024b/bin/glnxa64/gmake -j 6 -l 6
HOST            = UNIX
BUILD           = yes
SYS_TARGET_FILE = any

# Opt in to simplified format by specifying compatible Toolchain
TOOLCHAIN_NAME = ["Xcode with Clang | gmake (64-bit Mac)", \
             "GNU gcc/g++ | gmake (64-bit Linux)"]

#---------------------- Tokens expanded by make_rtw ----------------------------
#
# The following tokens, when wrapped with "|>" and "<|" are expanded by the
# build procedure.
#
#  MODEL_NAME          - Name of the Simulink block diagram
#  MODEL_MODULES       - Any additional generated source modules
#  MAKEFILE_NAME       - Name of makefile created from template makefile <model>.mk
#  MATLAB_ROOT         - Path to where MATLAB is installed.
#  S_FUNCTIONS_LIB     - List of S-functions libraries to link. 
#  NUMST               - Number of sample times
#  NCSTATES            - Number of continuous states
#  COMPUTER            - Computer type. See the MATLAB computer command.
#  BUILDARGS           - Options passed in at the command line.
#  MULTITASKING        - yes (1) or no (0): Is solver mode multitasking
#  INTEGER_CODE        - yes (1) or no (0): Is generated code purely integer
#  MAT_FILE            - yes (1) or no (0): Should mat file logging be done,
#                        if 0, the generated code runs indefinitely
#  MULTI_INSTANCE_CODE - Is the generated code multi instantiable (1/0)?
#  MODELREFS           - List of referenced models
#  SHRLIBTARGET        - Is this build intended for generation of a shared library instead 
#                        of executable (1/0)?
#  MAKEFILEBUILDER_TGT - Is this build performed by the MakefileBuilder class
#                        e.g. to create a PIL executable?
#  STANDALONE_SUPPRESS_EXE - Build the standalone target but only create object code modules 
#                            and do not build an executable
